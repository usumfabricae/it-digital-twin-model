# Product Overview

## IT Infrastructure and Application Dependency Ontology

A formal OWL 2 ontology for modeling IT infrastructure and application dependencies across six architectural layers. The ontology enables root cause analysis, impact assessment, and full-stack decomposition from business processes to physical infrastructure.

## Core Purpose

- Model enterprise IT infrastructure using semantic web standards (OWL, RDF, SHACL)
- Support dependency tracking across business, application, container, infrastructure, network, and security layers
- Enable SPARQL and Cypher queries for root cause and impact analysis
- Provide CMDB integration capabilities with formal validation rules

## Key Features

- Six-layer architecture with clear separation of concerns
- 50+ entity types covering modern and legacy deployments
- Framework alignment with TOGAF, CIM, ITIL, ArchiMate, Kubernetes, and cloud provider APIs
- SHACL validation shapes for data quality enforcement
- Comprehensive deployment patterns (containerized, legacy, hybrid, cloud)
- Query patterns for operational analysis and troubleshooting

## Target Use Cases

- Root cause analysis for application failures
- Impact assessment for infrastructure changes
- Business process to infrastructure traceability
- CMDB data modeling and integration
- Multi-cloud and hybrid deployment modeling
